# Alexa-InfoCenter

Update Sep 17, 2016

I have made an improved version which allows you to customize the skill through the use of cvs files.  It can be found here: https://github.com/ekt1701/Alexa-Good-Morning


My learn as I go project for Alexa Skills Kit and Python. This skill was inspired by https://github.com/Pizzaface/alexa-humidity

Currently, it gets weather conditions from Yahoo https://developer.yahoo.com/yql/console/#h=desc+weather.forecast, moon info from http://www.burningsoul.in/apis/moon, surf conditions from http://feeds.feedburner.com/surfline-rss-surf-report-south-los-angeles, earthquake info from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/4.5_day.atom

Update Aug 21 2016.

In addition the skill can get air quality from http://aqicn.org, news from the Los Angeles Times http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/rss2.0.xml, Random Quotes from https://www.quotesdaddy.com, Stocks info from https://www.google.com/finance, Jokes from http://api.icndb.com/jokes/random and http://tambal.azurewebsites.net/joke/random and of course Cat Facts from http://catfacts-api.appspot.com

The woeid for the Yahoo Weather API, is set to my location, so you will need to change it for your location. You can find your woeid here: http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/

The configuration is Runtime: Python 2.7, Handler: lambda_function.lambda_handler, Existing Role: lambda_basic_execution. The code is entered in-line.

Warning: I'm a newbie to Alexa Skills Kit and Python, so the code will be sloppy, bug infested and perhaps cause your Echo to self-destruct... :)
